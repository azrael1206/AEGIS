\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item board is a de10-soc with a altera 5CSEMA5F31C6 fpga
	\item need 2473 alm and 3703 flipflops
	\item need 2,624,256 bits of blockmemory, only simple dual port, that why we get only a resolution of 320x240
	\item and need 4 dsp
	\item the max frequency is between 81 to 85 MHz
\end{itemize}
