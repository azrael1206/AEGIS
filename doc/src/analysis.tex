\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item board is a de10-soc with a altera 5CSEMA5F31C6 fpga
	\item need 2473 alm and 3703 flipflops
	\item need 2,624,256 bits of blockmemory, only simple dual port, that why we get only a resolution of 320x240
	\item and need 4 dsp
	\item the max frequency is between 81 to 85 MHz
	\item the axi bus has a latence of ca 5 cylcen, depending of load of the axi bus
	\item the cycle may be different from the exact values because of the load of the ram and axi bus
	\item Fill Rect  the complete screen 131624 cyclen from start of the function to the end of drawing in software 4283088 cylcen
	\item Bresenham line from the point 0 0 to 320 240 1105 cyclen from start of the function to the end of drawing in software 180755
	\item Bresenham circle at the middle point 160 120 with a radius 20 841 cyclen from the start of the function to the end of drawing, in software 38176
