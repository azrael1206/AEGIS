With the emergence of RISCV a need to become independent from hardware manufacturers has become clearer and clearer. This has lead to an open hardware movement. To support such a movement we have decided to create an open source hardware graphics accelerator. This means that we have to learn how old and modern GPUs work and how one could go and create a set of features that are necessary for drawing graphics on a screen. This graphics accelerator should run at a resolution of \(640 \times 480\), with the ability do draw lines, circles, font, sprites and fill rectangles.
