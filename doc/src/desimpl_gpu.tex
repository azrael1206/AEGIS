\begin{itemize}
	\item no known modern embedded graphics accelerator
	\item we had to make an open design
	\item not as complex as a regular GPU
	\item more in the lines of a retro gpu like the ones found in an Atari ST or a Commodore Amiga
	\item should take load of the cpu, as the drawing operations would be done by software usually
	\item basic functionality: drawing lines, drawing circles, filling rectangles, drawing font, and drawing in some way a sprite
\end{itemize}
