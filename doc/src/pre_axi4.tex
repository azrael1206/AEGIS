 
The  advanced microcontroller bus architecture (AMBA) advanced extensible interface 4 (AXI4) is a bus system specified by Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) in the year 2010 \cite{6129797}. The bus system has many features, thats why not all feature is described in detail in this chapter.

The AXI4 is a bus that can handle multiple master and slave over intermediate level called interconnect. This construction allows an n to n relation. The data bus width can be 32, 64, 128 and 256 bits. But the address bus is limited to 32 bits. Which means that he can only address 4 GB of memory space. For a high data transfer it can use the burst mode. With the burst mode, AXI4 can transfer 256 words without to align a new address. To establish and to release the communication it use a handshake protocol \cref{section:handshake}\cite{6129797}. 

\subsubsection{Handshake protocol}
\label{section:handshake}
This section describes the handshake protocol that is found in the AXI4 bus. The first step is that the master put on the address and when data are written the data. After that the master put an high signal on the valid signal
