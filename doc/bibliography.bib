abstract = {This embedded tutorial presents an overview of the issues related to the test, diagnosis, and fault-tolerance of NoC-based systems. First, the characteristics of the NoC design are presented, together with an overview of the existing industrial NoCs. Then, the challenges and solutions for the NoC test and diagnosis are discussed. Current test strategies and challenges to test and diagnose faults in NoC-based systems are then presented..Finally, fault tolerance techniques for the NoC are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a 16-bit Forth CPU core, intended for FPGAs. The instruction set closely matches the Forth programming language, simplifying cross-compilation. Because it has higher throughput than comparable CPU cores, it can stream uncompressed video over Ethernet using a simple software loop. The entire system (source Verilog, cross compiler, and TCP/IP networking code) is published under the BSD license. The core is less than 200 lines of Verilog, and operates reliably at 80 MHz in a Xilinx Spartan R -3E FPGA, delivering approximately 100 ANS Forth MIPS.},

@article{Tsai2012,
abstract = {The next generation of multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) and chip multiprocessors (CMPs) will contain hundreds or thousands of cores. Such a many-core system requires high-performance interconnections to transfer data among the cores on the chip. Traditional system components interface with the interconnection backbone via a bus interface. This interconnection backbone can be an on-chip bus or multilayer bus architecture. With the advent of many-core architectures, the bus architecture becomes the performance bottleneck of the on-chip interconnection framework. In contrast, network on chip (NoC) becomes a promising on-chip communication infrastructure, which is commonly considered as an aggressive long-term approach for on-chip communications. Accordingly, this paper first discusses several common architectures and prevalent techniques that can deal well with the design issues of communication performance, power consumption, signal integrity, and system scalability in an NoC. Finally, a novel bidirectional NoC (BiNoC) architecture with a dynamically self-reconfigurable bidirectional channel is proposed to break the conventional performance bottleneck caused by bandwidth restriction in conventional NoCs.},

@article{Soliman2014,
abstract = {Abstract: A 1982 WHO report discussed the control of xerophthalmia, a form of blindness commonly associated with vitamin A deficiency. The disease, the most widespread and serious nutritional disorder leading to blindness, afflicts infants and young children. The recommended treatment schedule has been changed to oral administration of retinyl palmitate (110 mg) or acetate (60 mg) on 2 consecutive days, with a 3rd dose given 2-4 weeks later if this is clinical deterioration. Vitamin A deficiency also is associated with protein-energy malnutrition, diarrhea, and measles. Malnutrition, susceptibility to infection, and inadequate water and sanitation adversely affect third world children, yet the WHO report is optimistic about the control of vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia. Strategies for control range from short-term distribution of vitamin A capsules, to education on local sources of vitamin A or carotenoids and fortification of staple foods. Specific approaches to such strategies in developing nations are discussed. (wz)},
